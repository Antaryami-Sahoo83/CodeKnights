"Smart Traffic Sentinel" is a groundbreaking web application designed to address the escalating issue of traffic violations. Despite the omnipresence of cameras, adherence to traffic rules remains a challenge. Our solution leverages the ubiquity of mobile devices to empower individuals in reporting violations promptly. The application allows users to file complaints accompanied by video evidence, utilizing OpenCV video processing for automated violation verification. This technology enables real-time analysis, including license plate recognition and identification of traffic infractions. The system ensures the privacy and security of user data while maintaining transparency in the complaint resolution process. To foster a collaborative approach, we have integrated a bounty system where complainants receive rewards for contributing to safer roads. This incentivizes active participation and strengthens the community's role in promoting traffic discipline.
